                    Medium was founded in 2015 by 3 AAP students who decided to transform a design publication into a live event.
                    Together, they created RAW Expo, a design exhibition in which students from all across campus showcased their work.
                    The event was a huge hit - 500+ attendees proved that there was an incredible amount of interest in and need for an
                    interdisciplinary design group. From RAW, Medium Design Collective spawned, to become a community of designers who
                    collaborate on innovative projects and serve as a platform and resource for design dialogue.
