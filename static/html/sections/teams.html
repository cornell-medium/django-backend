                Starting in Fall 2019, Medium is launching incubate projects.
                They are created by our incubate teams, groups of 3-5 who are looking
                to create things that solve a problem, bring new perspectives, or address
                a pressing gap. Projects follow the design process and are themed to
                address the topics of the creative direction of that year. These projects
                can be anything from creating <a href="https://www.jialinke.com/pulse">
                an interactive exhibition</a> that relates pulse with music therapy to
                <a href="http://shiro.community/"> a website </a>of visualizations to
                inspire discussions about life.

                Medium hosts a variety of design events during the academic year.
                These events can include design panels, design thinking activities in
                collaboration with other campus organizations, design hackathons and more.
                Our biggest event is RAW Expo, in which organizations and individuals
                showcase their design work and design process at the end of the year.

                Medium Design Review is a magazine that is released at RAW Expo.
                The magazine aims to be a reflection of and dialogue on design work
                and design culture. The Design Review is a pulse of the design
                community both at Cornell, and in the design industry.

                to build and deploy web apps in Python, as well as
                become proficient with Unix environments, version
                control, front end web development, and UI + UX design.
