                It started with a conversation among the thought curators on the Editorial team. After Colton’s proposal of the “donut” diagram, we
                discovered that whenever we try to improve diversity of a design, its inclusivity will be the cost and decrease proportionally. And
                the following question thus came to us: will we be able to discuss enhancing diversity AND inclusion simultaneously in our writing?
            </p>
            <p>
                To answer this question, the thought curation team designed an experiment. The editorial team is split into two separate groups to
                compete against each other and design a recruitment process for “Triple A multimedia design fraternity. ” However, what the two
                teams don’t know is the fact that they are working on different prompts: one team is designing a selective and diverse recruitment
                process, while the other team is focusing on a selective and inclusive process.

            </p>
            <p>
                The two teams were given three weeks to develop their recruitment process, and presented in front of the entire team. We revealed
                the difference in their prompts right before they present to preserve the independence of their design thinking. The following will
                point out some major differences between the two design processes.

                The two teams both chose to use written application as their first stage of recruitment process. The applicants will submit an

                To evaluate the applicant’s passion while giving both potential and mature designers equal opportunity, the inclusive team
                decides to pick a variety of prompts and ask the applicants to critique three pieces of their choice. The team provides a
                total of nine prompts in three categories: branding identity, photography, and CAD.

                The diverse team aims to design an application process that classifies the applicants for them and builds a basis for picking
                equally from different design fields. Thus, their application requires applicants not only to respond to a prompt, but also
                requires them to submit three or more past designs reflecting their strength.
